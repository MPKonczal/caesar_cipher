# Caesar cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple and popular data encryption technique.
It is based on shifting letters in the alphabet (currently using a shift of 13 letters - ROT13).

Created an export module using ES6 Modules.
The main function (caesar) takes a string and then returns the encrypted string shifted 13 letters (ROT13). The function supports both uppercase and lowercase letters and the numbers do not change.
